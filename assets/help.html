<h1>Lock Pattern Generator</h1>
<h2>Program Help</h2>
Lock Pattern Generator is a program for creating random
patterns to lock your Android device with.
<h4>Why can't Lock Pattern Generator set the pattern for me?</h4>
If programs like Lock Pattern Generator were able to
set your lock pattern, it would be possible to write
a program that set an extremely hard pattern without
your knowledge to deny you access to your own device.
This wouldn't be hard to get around; Android allows
you to sign in with your Google ID if you fail the
pattern too many times, but it would still be a large
security hole in Android.  If you want Lock Pattern
Generator to be able to set your pattern for you,
file a bug report with Google.<br/>
<i>Also, if you didn't have to enter the pattern yourself
    to set it, you'd be more likely to forget your
    new pattern!</i><br/>
To make the process of setting your pattern a little less
tedious, there is now a button under the generate button
that will take you straight to the Android security
settings so you can set your shiny new pattern there.
Try it!
<h4>Basic use</h4>
Lock Pattern Generator is ready to use right out-of-the-box.
Simply click 'Generate' and a reasonable pattern will be
generated for you.  If you want to use it, simply memorize
it (which is rather necessary anyway), and click the 'Android
Security Settings' button.  This will take you to the security
section of Android's settings program.  From there you can
set your new pattern, at which point it will be active.  If you
already had a pattern or other lock set, you'll need to enter
it before Android will allow you to set the new one.<br/>
If you're having trouble identifying where the patterns start,
try checking 'Highlight First Node' on the settings page.
<h4>Custom generation parameters</h4>
The default settings are intended to work well for the vast
majority of people.  The patterns are a minimum length of 4, which
is the minimum Android will allow, and a maximum length of 6,
which is still in the realm of easily-remembered patterns.<br/>
If you don't like those bounds, you can easily set both the
minimum and maximum lengths on the settings page.
